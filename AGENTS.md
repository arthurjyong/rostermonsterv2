## Mission and current reality
Roster Monster v2 is building a reusable roster-allocation core with department-specific templates while keeping **Google Sheets** as the operational front end unless the repo explicitly changes that direction.

This repo is **not** a greenfield toy rewrite. It is an evolution/replacement path from the existing ICU/HD Google Sheets + Apps Script allocator.

Current implementation reality:
- GitHub repo content is the source of truth.
- **ICU/HD** is the first concrete implementation target and first parity reference.
- The repo is still in an **architecture-first, contract-first** posture.
- Near-term work should follow the active milestone/checkpoint in `docs/delivery_plan.md`, not invent parallel tracks.

Start here before making changes:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/blueprint.md`
3. `docs/delivery_plan.md`
4. `docs/roadmap.md`
5. relevant contract docs for the boundary you are touching

## Planning vocabulary
Use the repo's planning vocabulary consistently:
- **Product**
- **Milestone**
- **Checkpoint**
- **Task**

Do not introduce replacement planning language when updating repo docs unless there is a strong repo-grounded reason.

## Default working style
Assume the following by default:
- one narrow, reviewable checkpoint at a time
- small, explicit diffs
- minimum file/doc set first
- refine existing repo conventions before inventing new structure
- preserve boundary clarity even when it feels slower

Before major edits, identify the **minimum file/doc set** needed for the change.

## Architecture boundaries that must be preserved
Keep these boundaries explicit and do not blur them casually:
- **template contract**
- **snapshot/input contract**
- **parser/normalizer**
- **normalized domain model**
- **rule engine**
- **solver/search**
- **scorer**
- **writeback/output adapters**
- **sheet-specific adapter / integration logic**

Specific rules:
- Keep SpreadsheetApp and sheet-specific logic out of reusable core where practical.
- Do not hide department semantics in arbitrary parser/adapter/writer code when the repo expects them to be declared in contracts/templates.
- Hard constraints must stay explicit and must not be weakened into scoring/preferences.
- Rule validity must remain distinct from ranking/scoring.
- Do not silently collapse template-owned, snapshot-owned, and parser-owned responsibilities.

## Documentation rules
Prefer updating the **narrowest authoritative doc** instead of restating the same meaning in multiple places.

Use repo docs according to their role:
- `README.md` = front-door orientation
- `docs/blueprint.md` = stable architecture truth
- `docs/roadmap.md` = milestone-level delivery order
- `docs/delivery_plan.md` = current active execution truth
- `docs/decision_log.md` = accepted directional decisions
- contract docs = normative or implementation-facing boundary definitions

When writing docs:
- distinguish clearly between **settled decisions**, **open questions**, **confirmed facts**, and **hypotheses**
- do not present a first-pass or deferred item as if it is fully closed
- do not fork contract meaning into side comments or random docs
- do not reopen settled contracts without a concrete inconsistency, active-checkpoint need, or explicit decision change

## Coding and patch expectations
When changing the repo:
- keep the patch narrow and reviewable
- avoid broad rewrites
- avoid unrelated cleanup in the same patch
- prefer implementation-facing wording over vague philosophy
- use actual repo paths, names, and commands
- do not pretend to have inspected files that are absent

If code is added later:
- follow existing contracts first
- do not bypass contract boundaries just because a shortcut seems easier
- do not move operational sheet behavior into reusable core casually
- do not introduce hidden architecture changes without updating the authoritative docs that justify them

## Mandatory workflow for checkpointed work
For non-trivial changes:
1. inspect the relevant repo files first
2. state which files should change
3. state which files should not change
4. state why
5. keep the expected patch surface small
6. validate with the smallest real checks available in the repo

If a task does not clearly support the active milestone/checkpoint, treat it as suspect and say so.

## Validation expectations
Run the smallest relevant validation that actually exists.

For docs-only patches:
- run `git diff --check`
- inspect the changed files directly
- confirm no unintended files changed

For code patches:
- run only real repo commands/tests/scripts that actually exist
- if no automated test/build command exists, say that explicitly
- do not invent toolchains, packages, or CI steps that are not in the repo

## What not to do
Do **not**:
- broad-rewrite the repo
- invent missing modules, files, tools, or build systems
- restart from scratch when the repo is clearly iterative
- weaken hard constraints into soft preferences
- mix sheet-specific integration logic into reusable core without reason
- silently redefine architecture in code without matching authoritative docs
- touch many docs for wording alignment when one narrow doc change would do
- claim a file was inspected when it was not actually inspected

## File-scope discipline
Default to changing as few files as possible.

For each non-trivial patch, explicitly identify:
- which files should change
- which files should not change
- why
- expected patch surface
- validation plan

If the change cannot be explained that way, it is probably too broad.
